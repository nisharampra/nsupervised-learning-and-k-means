    "In this notebook, your goal is to design an unsupervised learning classifier based on k-means, and subsequently compare the performance with a supervised learning classifier such as k-NN. The first task relates to loading the IRIS data by using the scikit-learn module (as in previous topic notebooks), and subsequently applying k-means on the iris dataset.  The task is outlined as follows:"
